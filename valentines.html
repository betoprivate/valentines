      <p>Hewwoo baby girl, this is the second valentines we spend together and well, second time i'm trying to do something to you since i'm a broke ass college student living in a third world country, but welp, i'm doing this with love so i hope it's good enough ðŸ˜“ <br>
        I want to thank you for all the moments we've spent together, throughout this one and a half years we're together, from bad and great moments, you were always by my side and you still are, and i hope we stay together for the rest of our lives, and we can make all of our dreams to become true, all the travels, dates, plans we've talked so many times about pets and even kids, i want to experience it all with you, only you.</p>

      <p>When i asked you to make a board about valentines, i was planning it so i could be inspired and make this for you, but well, like you said, you didn't really understand what i meant, but i didn't want to ruin the surprise so i just ended up using it as also pics that you chose to put in here and let it a bit more pretty, <strike> (i hope it is)</strike>. <br>
        This is a small gift, but made with love and practice because i still don't really know how this will turnout when i'm writing this, but i'll do my best to make it look good, because that's what you deserve, and you'll be always able to just open it again, just like the first valentines gift i made for you, idk if you still have it or not, but yeah, i wanted to give you something that you could always remember that was made by me, something money can't even buy.</p>

    <div class="conteudo-tres">
      <p>Lastly i want to say that you're the best person i've ever met, i can't wait to make you the happiest girl in the world, be able to spoil you, give you so much love and affection, go on so many dates with you and just be so fucking happy, because you make me the happiest man in the world, you made my life better, and you keep doing it, more and more every time, i can't stop but to fall in love with you more every single day, and i hope this is something that never changes. You make me feel complete baby, you make me feel like i belong to someone, and you're my home, i don't care where i end up on, as long as i'm with you, i'll be happy, i'll have a reason to smile every morning when i wake up and every night when i go to sleep. I love you with all my heart, you're my precious angel and i'll be always with you!</p>
